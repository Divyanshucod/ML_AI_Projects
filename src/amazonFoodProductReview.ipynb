I've moved since, and it's probably been about three years since I've had them last, but I remembered how much I loved them and wished I could find them again. And now I have, which is why Amazon is the best! These are packaged exactly the way I remember, same box, same wrappers. I got it in two days with Prime and the package was perfect, no nicks or tears.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I find these to be a bit sweeter than I remember. It could just be me, but I was sure I'd recognize the flavor accurately. Though that's a little disappointing, they still taste really good and smell as awesome as ever. My fiance (who had never tried them before) now loves them too.\",\n",

Generally I just make this with boiling water.  Their taste is superior than the average grocery store hot cocoa offerings.  These are a real treat and taste like hot cocoa from a coffeehouse.',\n",

You might want to check Tractor Supply if you have one in your area for a little less. Other than that, this is really a great brand for dogs with allergies. I have a German Shepherd Dog who is highly allergic to a handful of things. This has definitely made her stop itching and reduce yeast infections. Her coat is very soft now. If you have dogs with uncontrollable itching and there's no fleas involved, it's definitely the food you're feeding him/her. Do some research and you'll find that grain based kibble can cause itchiness, hot spots, yeast infections, and reoccurring ear infections. Grain-free kibble is the best way to go. It's worth a little extra money to avoid vet costs.\",\n",

I wanted them to like them because they're good for them, but, although they ate them, they didn't treat them like anything special.  Usually if they get a treat they really like they run off with them, each to a separate area.  These, they took, and eventually ate, but they didn't hide them, or run off with them.  These are probably great for dogs that love peanut butter, but not one of my dogs does.<br /><br />If your dog likes peanut butter treats, I'd definitely give these a try, but I won't be buying these for my picky dogs.\",\n",

Do not let the pictures deceive you, the pods work perfectly in my Keurig B60 machine.<br />2.  It's comparable to the Newmans Own Extra Bold organic with less intense bitterness. If you like your coffee strong and bitter this may not be for you.<br />3.  The packaging is fine. It comes in vacuumed sealed bags. The pods are hard topped with a tea bag type of material bowl bottom that will allow the coffee to steep when the water is injected into the pod. This design leaves the coffee vulnerable to air and dust if not stored properly.  It's an easy fix. I just toss them into a ziplock bag when I open a vacuum sealed pack of pods. Not a big deal.<br />4.  It seems like the pod design is why the coffee comes out so well. It is ultimately more like how a traditional auto drip maker produces coffee without the wait or waste.<br />5.  Considering the quality you cannot beat the cost.\",\n",

I read the ingredients, which look reasonably healthy-a few more than a LaraBar, but nothing scary or unfamiliar.  The texture is like a typical healthy bar-chewy and sticky-but these bars taste pretty good (if you are used to eating these type of bars).  However, the taste of chocolate and almonds is lacking in this product.  It doesn\\'t taste bad, but it wasn\\'t what I was expecting.  This is NOT a candy bar, but it certainly has enough sugar.  While the sugars in this bar come from dates and agave, this isn\\'t a diet bar-17 grams of sugar just don\\'t let it be something that can be eaten daily.<br /><br />I would certainly choose these bars over a candy bar loaded with high fructose corn syrup and other unfamiliar ingredients.  These is a reasonable amount of protein, potassium and fiber (5 grams!), so this bar makes my OKAY to eat on occasion or after a workout list, but just don\\'t expect a candy bar taste.',\n",

The strange taste of it turned me off...<br />I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn\\'t impressed with that either.<br /><br />Maybe i\\'m just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.<br /><br />It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.<br /><br />No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that\\'s steep. And I surely won\\'t buy this in the future.<br /><br />You can go down to the local \"name of popular coffee shop here\" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.<br /><br />Melitta makes it sound like it\\'s the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package.

You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.

I can't even find the Maruchan Chili [Pepper] in grocery stores (though I can sometimes find the Nissin of the chili pepper flavor in stores). I got these Chili Pepper noodles on Amazon for around 25 cents each.<br /><br />The Maruchan chili is a bit more spicy and tastes different than the Nissin chili noodles. I'd say I like both equally well. No matter which flavor, they're a bit too salty. I sometimes will use one seasoning packet with one noodle package, because it tastes so good, but once in awhile I'll use half of the seasoning packet for one noodle package. I usually eat two noodle packages, so I just put in one seasoning packet. I put in about half of the suggested water in the frying pan to cook the noodles and all the water simmers away with no water leftover. I add the seasoning packet at the very end of cooking, so the flavor of the seasoning is still prominent, even with half the suggested seasoning.<br /><br />I like the noodles in various ways. I sometimes will add one or two eggs while cooking the noodles. Other times, I'll mix in a half cup of mixed frozen vegetables while it cooks.\",\n",

My latest love fest is with Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K promotes itself as being good for part of a weight loss program. The back of the box says that if you eat a serving of this cereal with skim milk, fruit and coffee that you'll have a meal that has less than 250 calories (although I don't know why you would want to add more fruit when you already have strawberries)! It's also fast free and cholesterol free. That's not why I bought it though. I bought it because it looked good on the box and I love strawberries.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal is made with crunchy rice and wheat flakes and has dried strawberries in it. Yummy - I love strawberries! Never before have I had a cereal with freeze dried fruit in it where the fruit actually tastes real and fresh. When I first saw the shriveled strawberries in my bowl the first time I ate this cereal, I was not eager to put them in my mouth. But then I poured the milk in the bowl and the strawberries actually plumped up and almost looked like I had freshly sliced them! Then I took a big bite and wow, the strawberry taste was awesome! The cereal is just sweet enough to not be like a kid cereal but still enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. And there are a ton of strawberries in the box - enough to where I always get at least one strawberry with every bite of cereal.<br /><br />Now let's move on to the flakes. They are a good size but not so big that they are hard to eat. Some cereals make their flakes too big for my liking but this one is just right. Plus the flakes stay crunchy until the last bite is gone from the bowl, unlike some of the other flakes made by Kellogg's and other brands.<br /><br />So for now, Kellogg's Special K Red Berries is my top choice for cereal every morning ... until I burn myself out on it and then I'll switch to something else for a while!\",\n",

Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them.

I\\'ve literally mixed this with milk- which has been GOOD milk, and several times not been able to force myself to drink the whole glass- I\\'ve had to pour it out- the non-chocolate odd chemical taste of the syrup- EVEN when mixed with milk- was THAT bad.<br /><br />Apparently if you only use a little bit- like maybe a small shot in a cup of coffee- you MIGHT not notice anything different.  But, if you try to taste this directly, or mix it with a reasonably lightly flavored substance- like milk, or water, or, perhaps, cake or cookie mix, I can virtually *guarantee* it will not taste the same to you- it has a VERY odd chemical, sour, bitter, or SOMEthing taste, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps, if this is the ONLY type of syrup you can use, due to diabetes requirements, or something, you might try it.  However, I would strongly recommend that you look through & try OTHER products first- and use this particular \"sugar-free\" one as a last resort.  Or, if you\\'re determined to try it, go out & find a single bottle in your local store- and try that.

       " \"Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.\",\n",

Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.<br /><br />For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.<br /><br />Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well.

       " 'My ship and I, (the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish named after the 12th Duke of Devonshire), were traveling the Bay of Bengal in the summer of 1938.  King George IV, had taken reign the winter prior.  His royal majesty from the House of Windsor still had a tentative grip on the British colony of India.  Hearken back to olden days of yore when imperialism was a goal, and not a mangy politicians word.<br /><br />We were making headway up the Hooglhy River into Calcutta under the guise of His Majesty\\'s Royal Trade Mission with peace offerings to the Maharaja of Bengal.  Calcutta was a dicey place round about that time, being our capital in colonized India you know.  The locals had grown weary of the legendary British hospitality.  A fortnight later, it was near the mouth of the Hooglhy River that we met a blind street beggar who promised us visions of prosperity.  At first we questioned this diminutive cheeky fellow, but alas, we listened to his tale.  We offered the blind beggar six British royal pounds in exchange for his gift of visions of prosperity.  And that is when it happened.  The blind beggar offered us this strange, yet edible fruit.  \"Eat the fruit of this Pomegranate\", the blind beggar said, \"and the visions of your prosperity will come to light\".<br /><br />For good penance, the blind beggar gave us seven pomegranates for our continued journey.  Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal, a fine purveyor of English tea\\'s, and the second most knowledgeable of my sailor\\'s had a unique idea.  Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal decided to steep some loose black tea leaves with blueberries we picked up from our travels along the coast of Palestine along with the strange edible portions of the blind beggar\\'s pomegranate.  Much to our extreme delight, what an explosion of flavor!  I informed Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal that he was definitely on to something.  While this delicious concoction was certainly no Earl Grey (as any honorable Britain would tell you, there\\'s no comparison to \"The Earl\"), it was certainly divine, chamomile be damned!  Though summer\\'s on the Bay of Bengal were most treacherous, with a cup of Blueberry and Pomegranate Tea by your side while fixing the braggywinkle\\'s on the bowline, the fresh smell of the salty air on your lips, a better day one cannot achieve.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal found a bottle of Glen Fiddyich stowed away in one of the hold\\'s.  Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal ended up getting pissed off the fine scotch and forgot his wonderful concoction.  In his plastered stupor, Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal heaved the six remaining Pomegranate\\'s off the aft deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, losing the wonderful recipe forever.  What Rubbish.<br /><br />Until the hack tea makers at the Lipton company devised their own version of Blueberry Pomegranate Tea.  While not as divine as the tea Boson\\'s Mate Micklegal concocted in that summer of 1938, they came darn bloody close.  Cheers Lipton!  Thanks for the memories.',\n",

Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars are delicious!  They consist primarily of dates, like chocolatey Fig Newtons.  The almonds provide a satisfying crunch.

A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.

I am not a food scientist or chemist, so cannot comment on whether the coffee has unique characteristics.<br /><br />I did visit a gourmet coffee shop that sold a wide range of coffees from all over the world who said they had encountered some less irritating coffees with low acidity.  So when Puroast claims that its coffee is lower in diCQA acid than other coffees it is being compared with well-known brands like Starbucks and Hills.<br /><br />The individual foil packaging keeps the already ground coffee fresh, tasting like coffee ground freshly from beans.  It definitely had a kick and woke me up. I drank the coffee I'd made with a packet big enough for a 10-cup carafe at 2 pm and was awake until 5:00 am.<br /><br />If you have a sore throat from drinking coffee and like drinks made with espresso coffee then this is worth trying.\",\n",

I had no idea what she had given me, but it was good enough to ask her what it was.  She had given me a cup of instant Douwe Egberts coffee, from a jar she had purchased in Germany.  The taste was so good and it didn't in any way resemble any instant coffee I ever had.  I thought she had brewed a pot of something special for me.  My next experience was at a restaurant, when I ordered a cup of coffee after dinner.  It was amazingly good, and when I asked the waitress what kind of coffee it was, she told me Douwe Egberts.  I noticed a pattern here.  I then began my search for the coffee.  I couldn't find a store that sells Douwe Egberts coffee, so I found it online at Amazon, and ordered two bags of whole bean.

My quick look-see around the Interweb revealed only that it\\'s the name of this Singapore-based ongoing business concern, involved with TastyÂ® Singapore, which is an initiative of the government-sponsored International Enterprise Singapore, an effort to promote Singaporean food businesses worldwide (which has a very colorful and very loud website).  And Tasty has got a nice, smiley kind of logo, too (see image).<br /><br />If the good folks at Gold Kili want this and their other products to take off in the US, they really need to work on their packaging.  The copy on the envelope is not very good, a bit awkward, coming off as having been developed by someone whose first language is not English (like Singapore Chinese).  The instructions open with \"For hot serving...\"  Well, I figure that has to do with heated water, but the 8th grader in me also instantly recognized a distinct yet seriously divergent possible type of serving method.  But I digress.  Knowing most Americans, the preparation text needs to be much more clear, with very concrete instructions, like starting with, \"Pour contents into a cup...\"  Second, the only measure of how much water to use is in metric.  I\\'m down with the metric, yo, but most Americans are most definitely not, so you\\'ve got to actually tell them to put 8 Â½ ounces into their coffee mug.<br /><br />Note that 8.5 ounces really isn\\'t that much.  It\\'s more or less a standard coffee cup, but in bigger-is-better America, that\\'s only half a mug.  I recommend Gold Kili up-size their portions for the US market.<br /><br />Man, that ginger scent--strong--comes barreling right out right away when you open the envelope, and then when you stir it up, a very distinctive aroma.  The scent is quite good, a very nice alternative to coffee; brewing up a lot of this would be a very nice aroma throughout the house.  And so how did it taste?  Well, it was sweeter than I expected, which was a relief.  That unmistakable ginger taste is really strong, that pungent, stinging taste, spicy and quite insistent.  If you\\'ve had Asian ginger candy and can take it and like it, this product will work for you.  I do think that most Americans will not take to this, as it is a most definitely foreign and highly specialized ethnic taste, something they\\'ve only gotten the slightest hint of at their local bland Zap Wok restaurant.  The lemon flavor is there, albeit rather subtle.  You get the lemon mostly in the aftertaste.  You do get a very distinct and lingering ginger aftertaste of the drink, and that unmistakable low-level burn of ginger at the back of your throat.  It stays with you for some time, even after drinking or eating something else.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty good hot, but is NOT good cold.  For testing purposes, I added nothing to the drink, no sugar, nothing additional; I think doing so would ruin it.<br /><br />My experience with the drink\\'s color was not what you see on the package, which appears to be a kind of semi-clear green tea.  It is very unclear if this is in fact some kind of tea.  All the envelope tells you is that it\\'s ginger lemon drink, and that\\'s all.  There\\'s no more info on the packaging.  The actual color is a kind of ruddy brown, much like a tea.<br /><br />And hey, in the grandest tradition of Indians, Chinese and Malays (and generations of colonial descendants) living so peaceably together in lovely, sterile, boring yet successful Singapore, this product is in fact halal.  Yay.  There are no kosher markings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you\\'ve spent time in Asia, and are up for something more than the ubiquitous, overpriced fare at Starbucks, this one will work for you as a morning drink.  For those not used to full-on ginger, this make take some adjustment.  The ginger taste is powerful, so is a good pick-up, although this product is caffeine-free.  It\\'ll be a welcome product for Asians and those used to strong ginger products, but will take some getting used to for most Westerners.',\n",

It doesn\\'t really taste like Pho, but it\\'s pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that\\'s the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don\\'t belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it\\'s just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it\\'s pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I\\'m used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho\\'s broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that\\'s sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that\\'s all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don\\'t), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of \"pho\". It still isn\\'t quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it\\'s actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done.',\n",

Of course it doesn\\'t taste (or look) exactly like real ice cream and it\\'s not super sweet. Just check the label and you\\'ll see why.

       " 'This is far from the worst dog food on the shelf. However, MUCH better foods are available for MUCH less money.<br /><br />If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that\\'s good for them, you probably won\\'t pick this food. Yes, it\\'s better than Wallyworld\\'s Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it\\'s far from great. Here\\'s why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what\\'s on the shelf at the store), this food includes corn. Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. The only good thing about this food is that beef is the first ingredient. After that, it goes downhill fast. There isn\\'t another good ingredient until you get to dried green beans, and there\\'s practically none in the bag (calcium phosphate and salt both come before the green beans). And that\\'s the only other decent ingredient in the whole bag.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word \"corn\" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It\\'s not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don\\'t want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (\"meal\" is okay; just means dried meat. \"By-products\" are not okay: that means ground up bones and toenails). This food does okay based on this one metric. Doesn\\'t make it great though.<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you\\'ll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I\\'m frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn\\'t mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, pedigree, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the \"good food usually costs more\" rule that I\\'ve noticed is Costco\\'s dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />This food is incredibly expensive, over two bucks a pound. You can do a lot better. For that price, you can get any of the highest quality dog foods available locally.<br /><br />Where\\'d I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal\\'s annual review of dog foods. It\\'s the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the \"dog whisperer\" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don\\'t use the \"but my dog likes this brand\" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it\\'s not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn\\'t make it healthy.',\n",

With it so enhanced at times i get over load and have a hard time breaking it down. just some background so you understand that this really is a above and beyond flavor, for the ones that want it at times. don't get me wrong, i love just plain good coffee, but now it is nice to know i can get the best of flavors and coffee in one cup. i haven't had that option before.<br /><br />Hubby just bought me a bag of the flavor fusions carmel. first time ever. i usually go through a pound of beans in a month.

I do prefer other brands of espresso, but Illy's consistency is great since it is to be found in many restaurants around the globe.<br /><br />So it is with some sadness that I write a negative review. First off - please note that this is actually a coffee flavored energy beverage made and packaged by Coca Cola. Illy has partnered in order to take proceeds by allowing their name to be used. There might be a some of their coffee used, but it would be processed coffee extract, and so there wouldn't be much reason to use expensive Arabica coffee when extract from lower quality Robusto would work.<br /><br />This canned beverage seems to taste pleasant enough at first, but then it starts to turn metallic. The coffee flavor really is a 'coffee flavor'. There is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink. Granted, it's only 45 calories, most coming from the beet extract sweetener.  And don't be fooled by beet sweetener, it's really no different than any other unbleached sugar.  It is regularly used to Chaptalize wine in fact.  Don't be lured in by the low calorie claim: fresh brewed iced coffee without sweetener? Zero calories. Yes. Zero. (okay, actually 0.01 calories! sorry!) So it's not like they're really doing anything crazy by offering this at 45 calories.  It's just less sugar added than the super sweet beverages.  Really it seems the sweetener was added to try and mask the artificial and metallic flavor.<br /><br />There are better iced coffees on the market.  I hope we really start to see some more variety and availability soon.  Other countries like Japan have a huge market for bottled and canned unsweetened tea and coffee, so hopefully we can get on the bandwagon soon.  Hopefully with better tasting results.\",\n",

It reminds me of a salad dressing but it doesn't go well with salad.  I don't like it with my tacos or burritos either.  The sauce overpowers the food by masking its favor, instead of enhancing it.

Mess with it much, trying to give it volume, and you'll give it distress, which it shows by becoming yet more fine and breaking off.  So I was very interested to see if this shampoo could help.  And it really did give my hair a little extra bounce.  Not a huge amount, but there was a discernable difference.  It has a nice fragrance, too, and my hair feels really clean without any residue on it.  My only gripe is the bottle.  It's smaller at the bottom than it is at the top, and shaped oddly, too.  That's fine when it's in the little pocket holder in my shower, but when I get it out to use it, it's very easy for it to get unbalanced and fall over.  But, it's not that big a deal, overall.  I plan to try the conditioner, too.\",\n",

At the very least it helps rationalize drinking this tasty canned juice.

       " \"SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.\",\n",

Even though Iams is considered a premium food, our concerns were:<br /><br />(1)  the second ingredient is corn meal and one of the proteins is chicken by-product meal (Chicken by-product meal consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice);<br />(2) Our dogs were putting on weight despite the fact that they are active, high energy dogs; and<br />(3) An  olfactory-related concern - when resting, the dogs passed gas - a lot of gas!<br /><br />The gas got us.  Even though Castor & Pollux is a more expensive dog food, we decided that it was worth a try.  Forty-five pounds of dog food later, I'm happy that we switched because the dogs love the food, their coats are healthy, they are active and seem to be slimming down, and, best of all, the gas issue is no longer an issue.<br /><br />Since this information isn't listed on the Amazon product page, and since ingredients are a main consideration when purchasing pet food, Castor& Pollux Large Breed ingredients are (from the back of the bag):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Turkey Meal, Chicken Fat Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Fish Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Cultured Whey, Monocalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Chicken Cartilage, Dried Papayas, Dried Blueberries, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Oxide, Choline Chloride, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, L-Carnitine, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Vitamin K1 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longibrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br />Each bag has a Best if Used by Date, and comes with an Unconditional Guarantee from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Our final decision is to stick with this food.

The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I\\'ve tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured \"cats throw up\" and didn\\'t worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it\\'s 4x the price of what I\\'d been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I\\'d switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I\\'ve noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.',\n",

I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice. I told her we love our pets, have learned to trust almost no one anymore and they were hurting themselves by selling products from China.<br /><br />As she explained,the confusion comes from the following: the \"Made in USA\" labeled chicken breast strips - what I have been using for my golden retriever puppy (who ABSOLUTELY loves them - really a healthy nutritious chew toy that lasts about 3 minutes - maybe 10 minutes for a little dog - when he sees it, he goes nuts - has never choked on them or had any negative effects I can see) is, as it says on the bag, Made in USA - they are processed in the USA and come from chicken raised in the USA.<br /><br />Smokehouse DOES sell another chicken product that does NOT say made in the USA on the package and this product DOES come from China.<br /><br />Buy whichever one you want.<br /><br />As to the complaints about not being able to cut them up easily - this IS absolutely true - so, if you want tiny bits of treat to use for reward based training, this is definitely NOT the product you want. I use other natural treats for this purpose (Merricks lamb lung is terrific for this use and my dog loves this product just as well - a one pound bag goes a long way - very easy to break up in whatever sizes you want in seconds)<br /><br />Finally, this product (chicken breast strips) has ONE ingredient: chicken.

Yes, this product has a strong coffee flavor, but it tastes more like a very strong brewed coffee versus a well pulled espresso shot.<br /><br />Given that I generally drink my coffee unsweetened, whether hold or cold, I don\\'t think I would purchase this product regularly.

I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I\\'ve lived in Italy.<br /><br />I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.<br /><br />This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).<br />This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.<br /><br />You can google \"extra virgin olive oil plastic\" and you\\'ll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste.

       " 'When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn\\'t much better. Third time\\'s a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you\\'ll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16\" thick, 5/32\" inside diameter, and 3/8\" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.',\n",

       " 'These are really tasty.  They  are not very sweet but the cookie wafers are crispy and delicately buttery flavored.  Personally, I do not think they taste anything at all like a Ritz cracker with no salt.  And I liked the cocoa cream center very much -- again not real sweet but really chocolately tasting.  The cookies are a nice size, too. I was leery of buying 24 packs here on Amazon based on a couple of the reviews but I did find it locally so I bought a test package.  The price was about 50% more than the Amazon price though. I liked them very much and NOW I will definitely order the case from Amazon so I can keep them on hand.',\n",
       " 'I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.

You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.',\n",
       " \"Dynamic Health Organic Beetroot Juice comes closer to fresh than any other bottled beet juice I have tried. It's also a little more expensive.  When I am traveling and can't make my shake, I usually drink about sixteen ounces a day.  I have found the plastic bottles sturdy enough to travel safely in checked luggage.<br /><br />Most mornings, I add fresh, diced beets to a shake in the blender.  No bottled beet juice even comes close to the strong taste and intense color of fresh beets.  Even though they are only about one sixth by volume, the fresh beets impart a vivid red-violet color to the shake.  The color and taste of beet root juice in bottled products is pale by comparison. Lacking scientific research, it is hard to know how much, if any nutritional value is also lost in bottling.\",\n",
